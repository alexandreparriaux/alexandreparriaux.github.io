Welcome here, where you will mainly find information on my scientific work. This website was last updated on **May 16, 2025**.

I am currently a Scientific collaborator at the [Time and Frequency laboratory](https://www.unine.ch/physique/), at the university of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland. My main research topic is related to the characterization and stabilization of lasers and frequency combs. In my PhD I also worked on electro-optic frequency comb generation for spectroscopic applications, and nonlinear phenomena in optical fibers.

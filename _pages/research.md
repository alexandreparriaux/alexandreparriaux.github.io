### Stabilization of quantum cascade lasers

During my postdoc at the laboratoire temps-fréquence of the University of Neuchâtel, I studied different possibilities to characterize and stabilize frequency combs generated by quantum cascade lasers (QCL). As these lasers were developed by ETH Zurich, these works were in collaboration with people from the Quantum Optoelectronics Group.

One major work to control QCL-combs was to study a novel actuator based on a NIR light illuminating the front facet of the QCL-chip. A full charecterization of this actuator has been made and we demonstrated a tight locking of a QCL-comb line on a DFB-QCL with a 10 times improvement of the residual phase noise [[APL-2023]](#APL-2023). This actuator was then used to design a master-follower dual-comb setup to study noise properties of stabilization schemes, which is difficult to perform in the MIR which other techniques [[APR-2024]](#APR-2024).

Further studies have shown that the NIR light could also be used for injection locking of the repetition frequency, stay tuned for more information on this.

### Electro-optic frequency comb

This is the topic I studied during my PhD entitled *Frequency comb generation by electro-optic modulation and applications*. The aim was to develop dual-comb spectrometers based on the electro-optic modulation of a continuous wave laser and to perform spectroscopy with it. This subject was closely linked to the use of optical fibers and nonlinear optics to frequency convert the center wavelength of the combs in a suitable spectral region for spectroscopic applications.

I published a review article on the subject of electro-optic comb generation in *Advances in optics and photonics* [[AOP-2020]](#AOP-2020), which is well cited (>200 in 4 years), and a book chapter that should come soon. In the last work I performed on the subject, I managed to extend the dual-comb spectrometer spectral region analysis in the mid-infared to perform isotope ratio measurements [[PRR-2022]](#PRR-2022).

### Nonlinear optics in optical fibers

During my PhD, I also had the opportunity to study several phenomena of nonlinear optics in optical fibers.
